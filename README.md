## Revenue & Margin Optimization Intelligence

### Executive Summary

Revenue reached $149.7M with a gross margin of 37%, exceeding the 32% target threshold.
However, structural analysis revealed profitability risk hidden beneath strong topline growth.

### Business Problem

While revenue performance appeared strong, management lacked visibility into revenue quality,
margin leakage concentration, and profit dependency risk across categories and regions.

### Key Findings

 - 35% of total revenue operates below the 32% profitability threshold.
 - Margin leakage is concentrated in one category (Beverage), with ~$4.38M in profit at risk.
 - Profit is highly concentrated in Pharma and Home Care, creating structural dependency.
 - Pricing changes have a significantly greater profit impact than volume growth.

### Strategic Implications

 - Implement discount governance in underperforming categories.
 - Strengthen pricing discipline as the primary profit lever.
 - Monitor revenue quality using margin threshold KPIs.
 - Reduce profit concentration risk through category diversification.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how revenue performance can mask structural profitability risks. By
quantifying margin leakage, modeling profit sensitivity, and identifying concentration exposure, the
solution transforms descriptive reporting into strategic commercial decision support.
